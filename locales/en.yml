about:
  title: About
  first: I am Arthur Danjou, a mathematics student at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris-Saclay but also a freelance software engineer.
    I am very interested in new technologies, development and computing.
    I am able to quickly learn new technologies to meet the needs of different projects.
    I am always motivated by a challenge and like to be well organized to produce consistent results.
    Being able to create software from scratch is a real source of motivation.
  second: I love sharing my knowledge and helping others. I do a lot of research and read a lot of technical articles to discover new features.
    As long as I share my passions, I will continue to do this.
